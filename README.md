# Hannigan-2016-ColonCancerVirome
Investigating the gut virus communities associated with colon cancer.

##Study Outline
###Introduction
Sample source will be the colon cancer 30-30-30 study that was originally published by Zackular JP.

> Zackular, J. P., Rogers, M. A. M., Ruffin, M. T. & Schloss, P. D. The human gut microbiome as a screening tool for colorectal cancer. Cancer Prev Res (Phila) 7, 1112â€“1121 (2014).

###Sample Summary
The samples are archived at -80C and are ready to be processed for virome sequencing. The bacterial communities have already been characterized by 16S in the cited paper.

* Healthy: 30
* Colonic Adenoma: 30
* Colonic Adenocarcinoma: 30

###Milestones
- [ ] **Fecal Virome Purification** of all of the study samples using my established protocol.
- [ ] **Pilot MiSeq** on sample subset to ensure protocol quality before committing to largescale library and sequencing run.
- [ ] **NexteraXT Library Prep** with the remaining 90 samples using a 96-plex kit.
- [ ] **HiSeq Sequencing** of the complete library in a *single* lane if possible, otherwise a single run. This will be done using the *HiSeq 2500 Rapid* chemistry.
- [ ] **Analysis of the Colon Cancer Virome** using the resulting sample set.
- [ ] **Manuscript Preparation** for presenting our findings to the community at large.

###Questions to Address
1. **What specific gut viruses are associated with colon cancer?** We know that viruses have causative roles in a variety of cancers, and this may be the case in colon cancer. Here we will evaluate what viruses are in higher abundance in colon cancer cases and may therefore play a role in cancer developement.

2. **What virus community signatures are associated with colon cancer, and how do these compare to the bacterial communities?** We know that there are bacterial community signatures associated with colon cancer developement and presence. What is the virome diversity associated with colon cancer? It will also be important to assess how these trends compare to the bacterial community signatures. In many cases, lower bacterial diversity has been associated with higher viral diversity in disease states.

3. **Can we construct an accurate predictive model using virome data, and can this supplement models using bacterial data?** We can construct models for predicting and classifying colon cancer based on bacterial community information. We will try this with the virus community data, compare it's accuracy to that of bacterial community models, and evaluate the extent to which they supplement each other.
