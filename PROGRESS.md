#Project Progress

##Completed Tasks
* Fecal Virome Purification & Sequencing Library optimization completed with mouse test samples.
* Test human sample DNA extraction completed to find that these samples to not yield suffient DNA for library preparation.

##Current Tasks
* Using dedicated test human stool to optimize virome DNA isolation yield using proteinase K, different kits, and fresher samples (the low yield cancer samples were quite old).
* This is currently on the back-burner as I am focusing on getting preliminary data for the phage therapy knockout project.
