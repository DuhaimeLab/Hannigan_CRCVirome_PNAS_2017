# Introduction
Colorectal cancer is a common and severe disease that is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The US National Cancer Institute estimates over 1.5 million Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2016, and over 500,000 Americans will have died from the disease [@Howlader:2016ed].

Although the cause of colorectal cancer remains unclear, its occurance has been strongly associated with gut bacterial communities. This association is so striking that bacterial community signatures have been leveraged as biomarkers to greatly improve colorectal cancer detection [@Zackular:2014fba; @Baxter:2016dj]. While an understanding of colorectal cancer bacterial communities have proven fruitful, other microbial groups have yet to be evaluated and may provide additional insights into the link between disease and microbial communities.

Due to their mutagentic abilities and their general propensity for functional manipulation, viruses are strongly associated with, and in many cases cause cancer. Unfortunately there is not much research
